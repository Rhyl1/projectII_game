## The Type Game - Project II
This game was put together for the Code Institue milestone project 2.

### UX
The game is made to be played in full-screen mode.
Start the game by clicking the <START> button in the screen.
After this random letters will appear; the user can score 20 points for each matched letter.
To stop the game the user can press the <ESC> button. After stopping the game the START menu will re-appear. 
The About button in the start menu links to an ABOUT info screen, explaining the working of the game.
